 * Base interface for all FASTEN plugins. Used mostly for discovery and loading.

 * The lifecycle of a plug-in is the following:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>The FASTEN server discovers the plug-in JAR in a provided directory</li>
 *     <li>The plug-in is loaded dynamically, through reflection.</li>
 *     <li>The {@link :name()} method is invoked.</li>
 *     <li>The server examines plug-in compatibility with each of the plug-in subclasses.
 *     If the plug-in is compatible, then it performs sub-class specific initialization (if any) </li>
 *     <li>The {@link :start() method is invoked}</li>
 *     <li>The server invokes functionality on concrete plug-ins.</li>
 *     <li>The {@link :stop() method is invoked when the server is about to shutdown}</li>
